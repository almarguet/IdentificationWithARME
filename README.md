This code is the implementation of the ARME method described in [1]. This code run on Julia v0.7.0.

See example.jl for an example of use of the code (generation of data and identification using the ARME method) and plots_results_ARME.jl for an example of plots pf results generated by the ARME algorithm.

Documentation is available for all functions via the help command.
